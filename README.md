# SpaceRage

## Creators
This game was created by Ramon Machado, Rafael Lemos and Rodrigo Machado. Our team was called R3.

## About
SpaceRage is a game we created in 2016 in our first year in college, it was required to finish Computação I.
Since we had no game programming experience, the game wasn't completely finished and had a lot of programming issues.
We decided to create it again from scratch, in order to achieve a full finished game and with better resolution.

## Development History
This remake was a project that we intended to finish in a few weeks, but then it got abandoned. This repository hosts the project, but it was never finished. Recently, I (Ramon) started to create a new version of it for PS1 (YEAH, A PS1 GAME IN 2020) and I have plans to create a new repository where you can follow the development.
